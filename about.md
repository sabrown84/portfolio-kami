## Hello, It's Me!

This is about me! I'm passionate about everything that I do. I enjoy fitness, but I also have a huge love for technology. I'm excited for what the future holds, and I'm proud of how far I've come. I'm a veteran to the fitness world, but I love it to my core. I always knew something was missing because now that I've found coding I can't get enough. When I am not coding or working out- I'm playing with my dog or hanging out with my husband. I'm an avid life learner who keeps searching for ways to teach the world about fitness...and now I will through developing.
