## Hello, It's Me!

This is about me! I'm passionate about everything that I do. I enjoy fitness, but I also have a huge love for technology. I'm excited for what the future holds, and I'm proud of how far I've come. I'm a veteran to the fitness world, and I love it to my core. I've always known felt as though something was missing. Now that I've moved further into the tech field I can't get enough. The possibilities are endless in what can be created for our world and I love that I now how a new way to explore that. When I am not coding or working out- I'm playing with my dog or hanging out with my husband. I'm an avid life learner who is always curious and searching for ways to teach the world what else is out there.
