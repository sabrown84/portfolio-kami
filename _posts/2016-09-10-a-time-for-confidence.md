title: A Time For Confidence 
---

Taking a step towards confidence makes causes the journey to keep going. To build confidence you let fear know that its losing. I keep learning and I keep growing. 

I attended a conference last week in NYC for Swift...trySwiftNYC to be exact. I loved it. Met a ton of people, learned that I can navigate the big Apple, and even learned more about Swift than I ever thought I could. I also did all of this by myself. 

Upon my return my mentor has presented me with yet another challenge... which is to clean up my portfolio and projects, search for a few jobs, and apply. I'm completely wigged out. My anxiety is high and it seems logically simple, because all I need to do is do some typing, refactoring, and submiting. He reminded me that the most they could say is no. That's where the fear is...what will they think of me? He said, "You need the data." Meaning I'll be able to ask questions and find out what I'm missing...what job may suit me better? 

The next step is to put it out there and see what happens. Here I go...
