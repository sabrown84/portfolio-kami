During the holidays there are always some of the best sales. Its also the best time to be secluded inside with nice hot beverage watchign the snow fall. Here in Atlanta we only get snow one or two days a year...it usually shuts our entire city down, but it can be blissful to dream about snow.

This holiday season I worked with my mentor on a few Alexa skills. I made three of them...can you believe that? It's so cool and they are rewarding me by sending me an Amazon Echo! I don't know where this road will lead, but I really like it. Here are my skills:

They are pretty interesting. Challenging, but I'm happy I had the experience.
