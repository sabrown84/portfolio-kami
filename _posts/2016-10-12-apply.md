Applying for jobs can be a scary place to be. I feel like the easiest thing that I have done so far is create/revamp my resume. I've gone over all the articles of advice on what goes into it and what should be left out. It should only be one page and basically sell a nice picture of yourself and your work. When I get to the part where I find a really cool job...I can't do it. I can't hit APPLY. I have all the random questions swirling around in my head...Do I measure up? Will they like me? Can I get through the interview? Will I get an interview? My mentor asked me what's my hold up. Why can't I hit apply? My excuses boil down to the fact that I am new to this. I love it. I'm passionate, but I'm just new.

I feel like I have so much more to learn before I'm ready...what does that mean though "ready"? I think I'll make it through this, but not knowing is tough.

Retreating into the internet search is my go to. I find so many cool jobs. I just don't think that I am good enough, but the question is when will I be? I go over my materials again...resume, linked in, portfolio, blog site, then I still don't do it. What is stopping me!!! I want everything to be perfect. I want every project to be dolled up. I just have to do the next simple step...hit APPLY!
