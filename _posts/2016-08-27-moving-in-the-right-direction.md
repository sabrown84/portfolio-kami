>The only constant in life is change! 
-Heraclitus

What do you know about change? Change is when you laugh, cry, or when you taste that delicious Ethiopian food. Time is ever changing...it never stops no matter how much you tell it to slow down. 

I have found myself being stuck on how this portfolio looks...the CSS(fonts, colors, and hovers), but I have also found myself just being completely obsessed with changing things just to see what happens when I save and restart the server. Just to see it "in real life". The best part of all this is the fun that I am are creating. It reminds me of being 3 or 4 and pretending with anything around me.  

This portfolio keeps changing...why? Because my ideas won't stop and the code is calling me. It's calling me to move, to create, to learn, to follow, and to lead. I haven't thought to much about being a leader, but it's a nice thought. It'll grow as I grow.
