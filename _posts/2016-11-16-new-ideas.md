title: New Things Coming
---

Change is the best thing about life. The only constant that makes the world go around. I want to make a lifestyle blog that I discuss my three passions. Korean skincare(I'm obsessed), fitness, and of course technology. Blogging will be more of a staple in my routine and I will have a good time sharing with the world what I love. So that's my next project. Along with everything else on my plate it'll be one more thing that brings me joy.
