What could I possibly know about programming, being a developer, or being a software engineer? I know I can't stop thinking about it: backend, frontend, mobile, ruby, rails, css, html, javascript, iOS. What follows is my experience, my yesterday, and my today.

**My Experience**

Patience is a virtue. Being patient can also mean fear. Stepping out of fears shadow is what I decided to do, which lead me on this path (slightly away from Fitness) into the tech world. 

I did the college thing and loved it. Completed 6 years...BS and MS in kinesiology and exercise science. Worked and worked and loved it once again, but I kept finding myself drifting to my computer (researching, reading, and exploring). Fitness ideas and techniques evolve similarly to the tech field, but the pace is different. People are diving into using gadgets to see/share results and winnings. 

I found Bloc. After researching for months I found a solution that would work best for me. A mentor, a sound curriculum, a huge community, and assistance/ guidance to follow. The best part: It's All ONLINE! Another movement in my career to love! 

**My Yesterday: Busiest Day of the Week**

>Work begins at 3:30am when I wake up. 
The commute at 4:25am and clock in 4:45am.
I teach a robust Barre class starting at 5:15am.
A few minor computer tasks, towels/cleaning.
Another class at 9am at the lap pool.
Then a break to eat and code.
Class again at 11am. 
Staff meeting 12:15pm.
Then the fun starts personal training from 1pm to 2 pm. (some days its longer).
Commute and home by 2:30pm. 
Another break to eat, walk the dog (Nala), exercise, and code. 
Commute to a contracted class I teach at 5:15pm.
Home again around 6:30 or 7pm. 
Cook dinner for 8pm and code a little when its simmering or roasting. 
9pm shower and contemplate sleep or code a little more. 
Then 3:30am comes back around. 

This is an account of my busiest day. Life varies for us all, some days are longer and some are shorter…everyday has a yesterday and we all get through them. For the most part I make the best of my day and I decided to fit my new dream of becoming a software engineer in to my crazy days. Live your busiest day. 

**My Today: Code Your Heart Out**

What does it mean to code? When is it safe to say that you’ve begun? When do you discover that you really like being frustrated or when you discover that you’ve figured something out? For me, the answer is today. Living in the present moment will maintain helps you focus. I’m so glad I went out and bought a Mac last year and I made the decision to start learning through Bloc at the beginning of this year. I have come so far and learned so much that there is no turning back now. I feel as though I wake up from dreaming about the ins and outs of Ruby and Javascript. At the same time, I still love fitness so I often ponder how I am going to marry the two and create something amazing. Today I will continue to learn and discover. What are you doing today?
