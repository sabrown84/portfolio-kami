## Explanation

A music player application that displays album data, and song lists. It also houses a control bar that plays, pauses, resumes, stops, goes to previous song, next song, and controls volume. Under the instruction of my lessons I went through many challenges to complete this project. I really enjoyed learning about the responsive aspects of HTML. And the many components of CSS is astounding and packaged nicely.
