## Explanation

A self-distructing to-do list application. The items are created and prioritized based on the date. Users are allowed to create, edit, destroy, and mark to-do lists. The list displays the number of days until each item is scheduled for automatic deletion. The items more than 7 days old are automatically deleted, and on the 6th day a reminder is sent to the user to finish those tasks.
